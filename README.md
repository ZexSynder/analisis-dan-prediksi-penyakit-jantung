## Introduction

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project utilizes machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data, including vital signs and other health-related features.

### Objectives:
1. Analyze the dataset to understand patterns and correlations.
2. Apply machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease.
3. Build an interactive web application using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
